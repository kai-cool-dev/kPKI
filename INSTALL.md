## How to install everything?

Currently we are working on two deployment options:
- a classic bash installer
- an automatic docker deployment

## Prerequisites

- working MySQL or MariaDB server
- working Nginx or Apache Webserver with PHP 7.2 and Phalcon-PHP Framework (Please read `html/README.md` for further instructions)

## Bash Installer:

You can find the bash installer under `install/install.sh`. Just run it, it asks for every required data.
